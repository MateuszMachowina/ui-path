# ⚙️ Invoice Report Automation – UiPath Bot

This UiPath project automates the generation of invoice reports from pdf invoices using OCR and emails them to a specified recipient. It's structured for easy deployment and reuse.
Tested with a set of sample invoices, it extracts key details such as transaction, customer and product details. Only fields programmed in the bot are captured. Tested on a fixed set of invoice layouts.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 Processes invoice data using OCR
- 📊 Exports cleaned data to an Excel file named dynamically with today's date (e.g., `Invoice Report 2025-04-24.xlsx`)
- 🧠 Uses an `.env` file to store the recipient email (e.g., financial controller)
- 📧 Sends the Excel file via Outlook to a configured recipient
